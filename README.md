### How to run

- Open `analysis.R` and run code line by line to reproduce the figures and analyses in the paper
- The first part ensures the large file called "taxonomy_names.csv" is downloaded from FrigShare and placed in the correct folder.
- Make sure all the packages are installed (RStudio will automatically suggest installing these upon opening the project)
- Source the remaining R scripts, which are self-explanatory. 

> Figures are saved to the folder "output/figures" and statistics are saved as tab delimited text files in "output/stats".
