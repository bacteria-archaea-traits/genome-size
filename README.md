### How to run

Run the code in the pipeline.R file to process all scripts. 
This loads the appropriate packages (installs them if not present), 
combines the main data frames, plots the figures and generates the stats.

Figures are saved to the folder "output/figures" and statistics are
saved as tab delimited text files in "output/stats".
